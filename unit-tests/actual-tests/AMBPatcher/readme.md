### Info about textures

`brown_brick.dds` and `brown_bricks.dds` are textures that I found on [openclipart.org](https://openclipart.org/detail/265429/brick-wall) (it means that they are in public domain).
* `brown_brick.dds` - 64x64 DXT1 compressed texture. (2 kbytes)
* `brown_bricks.dds` - 1024x1024 DXT1 compressed texture. (512 kbytes)
